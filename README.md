# ðŸŒ€ Slopopedia

A recursive wiki that builds itself, one session at a time.

## Concept

Slopopedia is an experimental wiki which recursively adds, improves, or alters content.

## Session Instructions for Claude

**Working Directory**: `/Users/jade/Documents/Activities/Code/slopopedia`

**Session Workflow**:
1. Always start by reading this README.md to understand current state
2. If there are any issues identified in this document under "Issues to address" focus on that for the session. After completion, remove the issue from the README.md file.
3. Otherwise, choose ONE of these activities.
   - **Activity 1**: Create a new page with interesting content
   - **Activity 2**: Improve existing content (critique content, make edits, add links to existing content)
   - **Activity 3**: Enhance site (features/design/operations) from Next Session Ideas in README.md
   - **Activity 4**: Brainstorm ideas for future improvement and track under README.md "Next Session Ideas". Ideas should be improvements in usability, design, and overall concept of the site.
4. Use TodoWrite tool to plan and track progress

## Rules

- You can propose new rules that you think will make this project better.
- Choose one activity per session
- Build incrementally on previous work
- Maintain the recursive/self-improving nature
- Focus on making the wiki more interesting and useful
- After doing something in the README under the Issues to Address or Next Session Ideas, remove the item from the todo list.

## Issues to address

None currently identified.

## Next Session Ideas

**Content Quality & Discovery**:
- Implement content scoring/rating system to surface high-quality pages
- Add automated content suggestions based on page connections  
- Create "orphaned pages" detector to find isolated content
- Add content freshness indicators and update notifications

**Enhanced Search & Navigation**:
- Implement full-text search with highlighting and relevance scoring
- Add tag-based categorization and filtering
- Create breadcrumb navigation for page traversal history
- Add "related pages" suggestions based on content similarity

**Collaborative Features**:
- Add page discussion/comment system stored in localStorage
- Implement page bookmarking and personal collections
- Create user-specific page creation/edit history
- Add collaborative filtering for content recommendations

**Visual & UX Enhancements**:
- Implement dark mode toggle for better accessibility
- Add page thumbnails/previews for visual navigation
- Create animated transitions between sections
- Add progress indicators for long content pages

**Content Management**:
- Add content templates for common page types
- Implement automated link detection and suggestion
- Create content archival system for old/deprecated pages
- Add bulk operations for page management

**Analytics & Insights**:
- Track page view counts and popular content metrics
- Create reading time estimates for pages
- Add content growth analytics and trends
- Implement knowledge gap analysis

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for persistence
- **Structure**: Single-page application with section switching
- **Data**: JSON objects for pages with metadata and linking

**File Structure**:
- `index.html` - Main wiki interface
- `style.css` - All styling and responsive design
- `script.js` - Wiki functionality and page management
- `README.md` - This file (operational instructions)
- `pages/` - Directory containing content pages as JSON files

**Key JavaScript API** (accessible via browser console):
- `slopopedia.pages` - Array of all pages
- `slopopedia.createPage(title, content, excerpt)` - Add new page
- `slopopedia.updatePage(pageId, updates)` - Modify existing page
- `slopopedia.linkPages(fromPageId, toPageId)` - Connect pages
- `slopopedia.searchPages(query)` - Find content
- `slopopedia.dev_createSamplePage()` - Generate test content
- `slopopedia.dev_reset()` - Clear all data

**Data Storage**: 
- Pages stored in browser localStorage as JSON
- Session count auto-increments each load
- Page structure: `{id, title, content, excerpt, created, updated, links[]}`

**Running the Site**:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `npm run dev`
3. Open browser to: `http://localhost:3000`

**Testing the Site**:
- Check all navigation works (Home/Pages/Random/About)
- Verify all pages load from the `pages/` directory
- Test page creation via console
- Verify localStorage persistence
