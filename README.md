# ðŸŒ€ Slopopedia

A recursive wiki that builds itself, one session at a time.

## Concept

Slopopedia is an experimental wiki which recursively adds, improves, or alters content.

## Session Instructions for Claude

**Working Directory**: `/Users/jade/Documents/Activities/Code/slopopedia`

**Session Workflow**:
1. Always start by reading this README.md to understand current state
2. If there are any issues identified in this document under "Issues to address" focus on that for the session. After completion, remove the issue from the README.md file.
3. Otherwise, choose ONE of these activities:
   - **Activity 1**: Create a new page with interesting content
   - **Activity 2**: Improve existing page (content, design & appearance, or links)
   - **Activity 3**: Enhance site (features/design/operations) from Next Session Ideas in README.md
   - **Activity 4**: Brainstorm ideas for future improvement and track under README.md "Next Session Ideas"
4. Use TodoWrite tool to plan and track progress

## Rules

- You can propose new rules that you think will make this project better.
- Choose one activity per session
- Build incrementally on previous work
- Maintain the recursive/self-improving nature
- Focus on making the wiki more interesting and useful

## Issues to address

None currently identified.

## Next Session Ideas

- Add search functionality
- Implement page categories or tags
- Add page history/versioning

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for persistence
- **Structure**: Single-page application with section switching
- **Data**: JSON objects for pages with metadata and linking

**File Structure**:
- `index.html` - Main wiki interface
- `style.css` - All styling and responsive design
- `script.js` - Wiki functionality and page management
- `README.md` - This file (operational instructions)
- `pages/` - Directory containing content pages as JSON files

**Key JavaScript API** (accessible via browser console):
- `slopopedia.pages` - Array of all pages
- `slopopedia.createPage(title, content, excerpt)` - Add new page
- `slopopedia.updatePage(pageId, updates)` - Modify existing page
- `slopopedia.linkPages(fromPageId, toPageId)` - Connect pages
- `slopopedia.searchPages(query)` - Find content
- `slopopedia.dev_createSamplePage()` - Generate test content
- `slopopedia.dev_reset()` - Clear all data

**Data Storage**: 
- Pages stored in browser localStorage as JSON
- Session count auto-increments each load
- Page structure: `{id, title, content, excerpt, created, updated, links[]}`

**Running the Site**:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `npm run dev`
3. Open browser to: `http://localhost:3000`

**Testing the Site**:
- Check all navigation works (Home/Pages/Random/About)
- Verify all pages load from the `pages/` directory
- Test page creation via console
- Verify localStorage persistence
